## Scraping the toothpaste products data from Notino's website (https://www.notino.co.uk/toothpaste/)

The webscraping.ipynb is a Jupyter Notebook file contains the Python code to access the page's data, select them and add them into the newly created notino_raw.csv. Further, the data from the raw file are loaded and the country, currency and scraped_at information are added into the newly created notino_transformed.csv file. Selenium is the library that was used to scrape the data, Pandas the one to transform them and save to files.
